# IrisFlowerClassification
# Overview
 In order to differentiate between the Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species of iris flowers, this research uses a machine learning classification algorithm.  Four characteristics—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—in the dataset aid in the classification of the flowers into their appropriate species.

# Dataset
 The Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning, is used.  Each bloom in the 150 samples is identified as belonging to one of the three species.  The dataset is perfect for classification jobs because it is balanced.
 
# Models Used
 The Iris Flower Classification job involved the implementation of multiple machine learning models.  A straightforward and understandable baseline is provided by logistic regression.  Through ensemble learning, Random Forest and Decision Trees enhance accuracy while effectively managing non-linearity.  While K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classify based on closeness to similar data points, Support Vector Machines (SVM) provide decision boundaries for improved classification.

# Performance Metrics
 The model's performance was assessed using the following metrics:

 Accuracy: Indicates how accurate a prediction is overall.
 Precision & Recall: Assesses the model's ability to recognize each class.
 For improved model comparison, the F1-Score strikes a balance between recall and precision.
 A visual depiction of accurate and inaccurate classifications is called a confusion matrix.

# Future Improvements
 Use deep learning models for classification, such as neural networks.
 For a real-time web application, use Flask or FastAPI to deploy the optimal model.
 To increase model efficiency, use PCA and feature selection.
